# @jsonpathx/compat (Archived)

This repository currently ships a single package: `jsonpathx`.

The standalone compat package is not part of this codebase anymore. The main `jsonpathx` package now provides the compatibility API directly. Use `import { JSONPath } from 'jsonpathx'` and the async `JSONPath.query()` API.
